## **PHASE 2: EXPLORATION + PHASE 1B LEGAL PRACTICE INTELLIGENCE**

### **üéØ DOCUMENT 1: Texas Hospital Powers & Duties (Enhanced Intelligence)**
**Document ID**: Powers And Duties Of Hospitals Texas.311  
**Jurisdiction**: Texas  
**Document Type**: Statute  
**Search Relevance**: 0.45 (High relevance for billing compliance)  

#### **üìã CLAUDE OPUS 4 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:**
> "This Texas Health and Safety Code document establishes comprehensive regulations for hospitals regarding foreign medical graduates, billing practices, emergency services, and data reporting. The statute prohibits hospitals from imposing special requirements on U.S. citizens with foreign medical degrees beyond Texas Medical Board requirements, mandates detailed itemized billing statements within 30 days of discharge, prohibits discrimination in emergency services, and creates frameworks for infant transport reimbursement and patient risk identification systems."

#### **üîç AI-EXTRACTED KEY FINDINGS:**
> "Texas hospitals are prohibited from discriminating in emergency services based on ability to pay, race, religion, or national ancestry, with criminal penalties ranging from misdemeanors to felonies for violations. Hospitals must provide transparent billing practices, including itemized statements within 30 days of request, and are prohibited from billing for services not provided or medically unnecessary. The statute protects foreign medical graduates from discriminatory requirements and ensures infant transport to NICUs regardless of family's ability to pay."

#### **üí° PHASE 1B PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:**
> "Hospitals must provide clear, itemized bills within 30 days when requested and cannot charge for services not actually provided. Emergency medical care cannot be denied to anyone based on their ability to pay or personal characteristics like race or religion. U.S. citizens with foreign medical degrees from recognized schools cannot face extra hurdles beyond standard Texas licensing requirements. Hospitals must have systems to identify patients with specific medical risks and provide appropriate care coordination. The state will help reimburse hospitals for transporting critically ill infants to specialized care units when families cannot afford it."

### **üéØ DOCUMENT 2: Texas Medical Malpractice Statistics (Financial Intelligence)**
**Document ID**: Texas Medical Malpractice Key Statistics And Trends Summary  
**Jurisdiction**: Texas  
**Document Type**: Regulation

Patients harmed by medical errors have received $5.6 billion in compensation over 36 years, though lawsuits have become less common. The state has shifted from reactive lawsuits to preventive administrative measures to protect patient safety. Despite fewer malpractice cases being filed, settlement amounts have increased, suggesting more selective but costly litigation."
