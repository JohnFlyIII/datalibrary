This use case implements semantic search in [news](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset) articles. The dataset is filtered for news in the 'BUSINESS' category.

We are embedding

- headlines

- news body (short description)

- and date


to be able to search for

- notable events, or

- related articles to a specific story.


There is a possibility to skew the results towards older or fresher news, and also to influence the results using a specific search term.
