The InMemoryExecutor provides an in-memory implementation for executing queries against indexed data.
It creates optimized vector spaces based on the provided indices
and allows querying data from in-memory sources.

Args:
    sources (InMemorySource | Sequence[InMemorySource]): One or more in-memory data sources to query against.
        Can be a single source or sequence of sources.
    indices (Index | Sequence[Index]): One or more indices that define the vector spaces.
        Can be a single index or sequence of indices.
    context_data (Mapping[str, Mapping[str, ContextValue]] | None, optional): Additional context data
        for execution. The outer mapping key represents the context name, inner mapping contains
        key-value pairs for that context. Defaults to None.
