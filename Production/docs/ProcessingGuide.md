## Phase 1: AI Preprocessing

### 1.1 Fact Extraction Process

The system will analyze the PDF and extract key facts with citations:

```json
{
  "extracted_facts": [
    {
      "fact": "The statute of limitations for personal injury claims is two years",
      "citation": "Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 16.003",
      "location": "p. 245, ¶ 2",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "context": "limitation period, personal injury"
    },
    {
      "fact": "Punitive damages are capped at the greater of $200,000 or two times economic damages plus non-economic damages up to $750,000",
      "citation": "Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.008",
      "location": "p. 512, ¶ 1",
      "confidence": 0.98,
      "context": "damages, punitive, caps"
    },
    {
      "fact": "A defendant may designate a responsible third party within 60 days after filing an answer",
      "citation": "Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 33.004",
      "location": "p. 387, ¶ 3",
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "context": "third party, designation, deadline"
    }
  ],
  "fact_count": 847,
  "extraction_timestamp": "2025-01-17T10:30:00Z",
  "extraction_model": "gpt-4-turbo",
  "preprocessing_version": "1.0"
}
```

### 1.2 Summary Generation

Executive summary (≤1 page):

```json
{
  "executive_summary": "The Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code governs civil litigation procedures and available remedies in Texas state courts. Key provisions include statutes of limitations, damages calculations, venue requirements, and specialized procedures for specific case types.",
  
  "summary_bullet_points": [
    "• Establishes 2-year limitations period for most personal injury claims and 4-year period for breach of contract",
    "• Implements proportionate responsibility system for multi-party litigation with 51% bar rule",
    "• Caps punitive damages and provides framework for exemplary damages awards",
    "• Defines venue rules based on defendant's residence and cause of action location",
    "• Creates specialized procedures for medical liability, construction defects, and consumer protection",
    "• Mandates alternative dispute resolution in certain cases before trial",
    "• Provides prejudgment and post-judgment interest calculations",
    "• Establishes frivolous lawsuit sanctions and vexatious litigant procedures"
  ],
  
  "summary_conclusion": "This comprehensive code provides the procedural framework and substantive remedies for civil litigation in Texas, balancing plaintiff recovery rights with defendant protections through damage caps, responsibility allocation, and procedural requirements.",
  
  "key_takeaways": [

    "Understand damage caps before advising clients on potential recovery",
    "Consider proportionate responsibility in multi-defendant cases",
    "Follow strict venue and procedural requirements to avoid dismissal"
  ]
}
```

## Phase 2: Metadata Generation

### 2.1 Automatic Metadata Extraction

The system generates initial metadata based on document analysis:

```json
{
  "id": "tx-cprc-2024-full",
  "title": "Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code",
  "content_type": "statute",
  "authority_level": "primary",
  
  "jurisdiction_country": "united_states",
  "jurisdiction_state": "texas",
  "jurisdiction_city": null,
  "jurisdiction_full_path": "united_states/texas",
  
  "practice_area_primary": "civil_procedure",
  "practice_area_secondary": "litigation",
  "practice_area_specific": [
    "statutes_of_limitations",
    "damages",
    "venue",
    "discovery",
    "alternative_dispute_resolution"
  ],
  "practice_area_full_path": "litigation/civil_procedure",
  
  "published_date": "2024-01-01",
  "effective_date": "2024-01-01",
  "last_updated": "2024-01-17",

  ],
  
  "target_audience": ["practitioners", "judges", "law_students"],
  "complexity_level": "intermediate",
  "coverage_scope": "comprehensive",
  
  "confidence_score": 85,
  "human_reviewed": false,
  "preprocessing_complete": true
}
```

### 2.2 Chunking Strategy

For a 1,500-page document, the system creates chunks:

```json
{
  "chunking_config": {
    "method": "semantic_with_overlap",
    "chunk_size": 2000,
    "overlap": 200,
    "total_chunks": 3750
  },
  
  "sample_chunk": {
    "id": "tx-cprc-2024-full-chunk-0245",
    "parent_document_id": "tx-cprc-2024-full",
    "chunk_index": 245,
    "start_char": 489000,
    "end_char": 491000,
    "chunk_context": "Chapter 16 - Limitations",
    "is_chunk": true,
    "content_text": "Sec. 16.003. TWO-YEAR LIMITATIONS PERIOD. (a) Except as provided by Sections 16.010, 16.0031, and 16.0045, a person must bring suit for trespass for injury to the person or for injury to the personal property of another not later than two years after the day the cause of action accrues..."
  }
}
```

## Phase 3: Human Enrichment
