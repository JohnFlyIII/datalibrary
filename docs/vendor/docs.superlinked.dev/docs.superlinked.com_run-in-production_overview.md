The [Superlinked Server](https://pypi.org/project/superlinked-server/) allows you to leverage the power of Superlinked in deployable projects. With a single command, you can run a Superlinked-powered app instance that creates REST endpoints and connects to external Vector Databases. This makes it an ideal solution for those seeking an easy-to-deploy environment for their Superlinked projects.

To get started, check out the [Superlinked Server Setup](https://docs.superlinked.com/run-in-production/index).
